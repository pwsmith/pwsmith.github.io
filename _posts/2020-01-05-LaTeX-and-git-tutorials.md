Over some weeks in the last semester, I taught a tutorial on how to use LaTeX most effectively for the students in the Graduiertenkolleg in Frankfurt, for when they are writing their PhDs.
The slides that I used can be found [here](https://pwsmith.github.io/reveal.js/index.html).

The classes looked at the following:
- Selecting and using a good text editor.
- How to set Atom up for LaTeX (which we used as an exemplar of a good text editor).
- Writing snippets in Atom.
- How and why to use linguistic symbols in Unicode (rather than tipa).
- LaTeX document structure for a thesis.
- How to install and use git and Gitkraken.
- *Why* to use git for a PhD.

Thanks to all the participants in the classes: I enjoyed teaching them a lot, and hope to get the chance to do something similar in the future.
The classes stemmed from the article [What I wish I knew when starting my PhD](/2019/08/25/what-I-wish-I-knew-when-starting-my-PhD/).
