A few weeks ago I finished a paper that will appear in The Cambridge Handbook of Distrubuted Morphology. 
The chapter surveys the relationship, similarities and differences between Minimalism and Distributed Morphology and how the approaches to syntax and morphology respectively developed together.
A pre-publication draft is available [here](/assets/docs/pwsmith_dm_minimalism.pdf).
