Two of my papers have been published in '[Agree to Agree: Agreement in the Minimalist Programme](https://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/254)', a volume I co-edited.
The [first paper](https://langsci-press.org/catalog/view/254/2085/1774-1) is an introduction to how agreement is handled in Minimalism, written with Johannes Mursell and Katharina Hartmann, the co-editors of the book.

The second paper [Object agreement and grammatical functions: A re-evaluation ](https://langsci-press.org/catalog/view/254/2088/1777-1) discusses object agreement in Khanty, arguing that it is possible to understand the complex pattern of object agreement configurationally, rather than resorting to grammatical functions, as [Dalrymple & Nikolaeva](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/objects-and-information-structure) do.
