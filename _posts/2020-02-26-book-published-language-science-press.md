A book that I co-edited 'Agree to Agree: Agreement in the Minimalist Programme' has been published by [Language Science Press](https://langsci-press.org/) as part of the [Open Generative Syntax](https://langsci-press.org/catalog/series/ogs) series.
The book collects papers from various authors on the topic of the current state of the art of agreement in Minimalism. 
It's published open-access, and so [freely available](https://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/254) online, thanks to OGS.
