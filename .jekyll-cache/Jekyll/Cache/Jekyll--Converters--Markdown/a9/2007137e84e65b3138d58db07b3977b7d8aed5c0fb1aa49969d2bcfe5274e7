I"N<p>I’m happy to say that a paper I co-wrote with Sam Issah (Univeristy of Education, Wineba), <em>Subject and non-subject ex-situ focus in Dagbani</em>, has been published in Glossa.
The paper discussed focus marking in Dagbani, and how locally moved subjects that are focussed come to be marked morphologically different to other arguments under focus.
It’s available open access <a href="https://www.glossa-journal.org/articles/10.5334/gjgl.664/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>This paper offers a description and account of the patterns of ex-situ focus in Dagbani. We show that there are two syntactic strategies for creating ex-situ focus in the language, one involving A’-movement to the left periphery, and the second involving base generation in the left periphery combined with coreference to a resumptive pronoun. Furthermore, we argue that subjects are difficult to move from Spec,TP to Spec,CP in the left-periphery because of anti-locality, which creates a tension when trying to focus subjects, which are required to derivationally fill the specifier of both positions. We further show that what looks to be a two-way distinction between the behaviour of subjects and non-subjects in the language is in fact a three-way distinction between subjects that are focussed to a local left-periphery, subjects that are focussed to a non-local left-periphery, and non-subjects. These distinctions arise due to there being two methods for Dagbani to resolve the antilocality problem of subject movement, and so local subjects solve the problem differently to non-local subjects.</p>
