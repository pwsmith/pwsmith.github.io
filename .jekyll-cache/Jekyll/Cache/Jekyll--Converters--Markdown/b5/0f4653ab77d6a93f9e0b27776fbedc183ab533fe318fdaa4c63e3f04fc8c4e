I"l<p>Two of my papers have been published in ‘<a href="https://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/254">Agree to Agree: Agreement in the Minimalist Programme</a>’, a volume I co-edited.
The <a href="https://langsci-press.org/catalog/view/254/2085/1774-1">first paper</a> is an introduction to how agreement is handled in Minimalism, written with Johannes Mursell and Katharina Hartmann, the co-editors of the book.</p>

<p>The second paper <a href="https://langsci-press.org/catalog/view/254/2088/1777-1">Object agreement and grammatical functions: A re-evaluation </a> discusses object agreement in Khanty, arguing that it is possible to understand the complex pattern of object agreement configurationally, rather than resorting to grammatical functions, as <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/objects-and-information-structure">Dalrymple &amp; Nikolaeva</a> do.</p>
